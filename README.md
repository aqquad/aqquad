I tend to create things for older versions of the game Rec Room.

[RebornRec](https://github.com/aqquad/RebornRec) is currently the main project I've been working on since January 18th, 2023, allowing people to easily access and do whatever with older versions of Rec Room.

You can reach me on Discord at @june_x3, or check some of the silly things I've done with Rec Room on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@aquad).
